The solution is to use the strict comparison operator (`===`) instead of the loose comparison operator (`==`). The strict comparison operator checks both the value and the type of the operands.  This ensures that the comparison yields the expected result even when the operands have different types. For example:  ```php <?php $stringVal = '10'; $intVal = 10; if ($stringVal === $intVal) {     echo "Values are strictly equal"; } else {     echo "Values are not strictly equal"; } ?> ``` This corrected version will accurately reflect that the string '10' and the integer 10 are not strictly equal.
