This code suffers from a subtle issue related to how PHP handles type juggling and comparison.  The `==` operator performs loose comparison, leading to unexpected results when comparing strings and numbers. In the example, '10' (string) is compared to 10 (integer).  Loose comparison considers them equal, while strict comparison (`===`) would consider them different because of the type mismatch. This behavior can cause logic errors, especially in conditional statements, when comparing user input or values from databases where the data type might not be consistent.
